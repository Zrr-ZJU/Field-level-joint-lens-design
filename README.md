## Key contributions 
- Using a **customized differential operator** that efficiently arrange the memory, we develop a differentiable optical simulation model that avoids exponentially growing computation overhead and could accurately calculates coherent PSFs;
- A joint optimization pipeline is presented that **not only enhances image quality**, but also **successively improves the performance of optics** across multiple lenses that are already in professional level;
- For the first time, we show that joint optimization could realize a **field-level PSF control** in advanced optical design, revealing its tremendous potential by bringing evaluated lenses approaching the diffraction limit with an improved effective modulation transfer function (EMTF).
